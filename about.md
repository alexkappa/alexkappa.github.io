Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Alex! I'm a Software Engineering Manager based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

I work in the Pricing domain at [Beat](https://thebeat.co). Before that I've lead the engineering teams at Kambr and Yieldr.

On my free time I work on personal or community projects. I am the maintainer of the [Auth0 terraform provider](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-auth0) and the [Auth0 SDK for Go](https://github.com/go-auth0/auth0) among [other](https://github.com/alexkappa/mustache) [fun](https://github.com/alexkappa/exp) [projects](https://github.com/alexkappa/trie).
